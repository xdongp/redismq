There is no point in writing &quot;u:1000:pwd&quot; as key if you can write instead &quot;user:1000:password&quot;, the latter is more readable and the added space is very little compared to the space used by the key object itself.<\/li><li> Try to stick with a schema.

Redis keys	redis_test/doc/IntroductionToRedisDataTypes.html	/^It's not always trivial to grasp how this data types work and what to use in order to solve a given problem from the <a href="CommandReference.html">Redis command reference<\/a>, so this document is a crash course to Redis data types and their most used patterns.<br\/><br\/>For all the examples we'll use the <b>redis-cli<\/b> utility, that's a simple but handy command line utility to issue commands against the Redis server.<h2><a name="Redis keys">Redis keys<\/a><\/h2>Before to start talking about the different kind of values supported by Redis it is better to start saying that keys are not binary safe strings in Redis, but just strings not containing a space or a newline character. For instance &quot;foo&quot; or &quot;123456789&quot; or &quot;foo_bar&quot; are valid keys, while &quot;hello world&quot; or &quot;hello\\n&quot; are not.<br\/><br\/>Actually there is nothing inside the Redis internals preventing the use of binary keys, it's just a matter of protocol, and actually the new protocol introduced with Redis 1.2 (1.2 betas are 1.1.x) in order to implement commands like MSET, is totally binary safe. Still for now consider this as an hard limit as the database is only tested with &quot;normal&quot; keys.<br\/><br\/>A few other rules about keys:<br\/><br\/><ul><li> Too long keys are not a good idea, for instance a key of 1024 bytes is not a good idea not only memory-wise, but also because the lookup of the key in the dataset may require several costly key-comparisons.<\/li><li> Too short keys are not a good idea. There is no point in writing &quot;u:1000:pwd&quot; as key if you can write instead &quot;user:1000:password&quot;, the latter is more readable and the added space is very little compared to the space used by the key object itself.<\/li><li> Try to stick with a schema. For instance &quot;object-type:id:field&quot; can be a nice idea, like in &quot;user:1000:password&quot;.
